Not really a license, but basically, these fonts were made with DrDnar's
Monochrome Font Editor (MFE) for Grammer 2 and other projects (by Zeda Thomas).

Feel free to use these fonts, but if you want to edit them to be included in one
of Zeda Thomas' projects (i.e. Grammer, Parnsip, BatLib, etc.), it's with the
expectation that anybody will be allowed to freely use it.
